# # RAG: Answer your questions with Exa and OpenAI's Responses API

# This example demonstrates how to use Exa with OpenAI's new responses API
# for retrieval-augmented generation.

# Install the required packages:
# pip install exa-py openai

# Example for a more complex query with paragraph input
paragraph = """Georgism, also known as Georgism, is an economic philosophy and ideology named after the American political economist Henry George (1839â€“1897). This doctrine advocates for the societal collective, rather than individual property owners, to capture the economic value derived from land and other natural resources. To this end, Georgism proposes a single tax on the unimproved value of land, known as a "land value tax," asserting that this would deter speculative land holding and promote efficient use of valuable resources. Adherents argue that because the supply of land is fundamentally inelastic, taxing it will not deter its availability or use, unlike other forms of taxation. Georgism differs from Marxism and capitalism, underscoring the distinction between common and private property while largely contending that individuals should own the fruits of their labor."""
